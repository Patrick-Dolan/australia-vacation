        <h1>The Perfect Australia Vacation</h1>
        <p>
          Australia is an awesome place to have a vacation! I have friends there that I 
          want to see since its been years. They have come and visit me here, even 
          coming to my wedding but I still haven't had the chance to visit them.

        <p>
          See lots of people think this place is cool! If you need any reason or convincing 
          just look at what others have said after their visit to the land down under.

                  We brought our big hairy friend from the pacific northwest in search of a 
                  place for him to hide since its considered a big game to people to chase him 
                  in the woods. This turned out to be a great place to hide since the wildlife 
                  is known to be dangerous and everyone just leaves people trundling around 
                  alone, as they should.

                  We had a kind of crazy adventure with a kangaroo named Jack and a Jacket I 
                  got in Brooklyn. Things turned out well but I sure hope my next visit is a bit
                  more tame. Maybe check out a museum or something.

                  We loved the sights and sounds. We went to sydney and the city is rich with 
                  culture. I feel like if someone were wto use this as an example on a site or 
                  something it would be clear they've run out of movie quotes and ideas.
