      <h1>The Perfect Australia Vacation</h1>
      <p>
        Australia is an awesome place to have a vacation! I have friends there that I 
        want to see since its been years. They have come and visit me here, even 
        coming to my wedding but I still haven't had the chance to visit them.

        See lots of people think this place is cool! If you need any reason or convincing 
        just look at what others have said after their visit to the land down under.

                We brought our big hairy friend from the pacific northwest in search of a 
                place for him to hide since its considered a big game to people to chase him 
                in the woods. This turned out to be a great place to hide since the wildlife 
                is known to be dangerous and everyone just leaves people trundling around 
                alone, as they should.

                We had a kind of crazy adventure with a kangaroo named Jack and a Jacket I 
                got in Brooklyn. Things turned out well but I sure hope my next visit is a bit
                more tame. Maybe check out a museum or something.

                We loved the sights and sounds. We went to sydney and the city is rich with 
                culture. I feel like if someone were wto use this as an example on a site or 
                something it would be clear they've run out of movie quotes and ideas.

                The canoe is one of the oldest methods of travel and you can

                This is probably one of the hardest ways since you'll have 
                to run for many weeks straight. Also you'll have to run fast enough to skim 
                across the water. An added benefit is that if you're the first one to do it 
                you get free citizenship and all the gatorade you can drink.

                While this is the least imaginative way of reaching Australia 
                I hear that it is the most reliable and easy to do. You do have sit on a plane for about
                18 hours but in comparison to running that kind of sounds nice.
