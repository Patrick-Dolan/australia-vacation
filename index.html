              We brought our big hairy friend from the pacific northwest in search of a 
              place for him to hide since its considered a big game to people to chase him 
              in the woods. This turned out to be a great place to hide since the wildlife 
              is known to be dangerous and everyone just leaves people trundling around 
              alone, as they should.

              We had a kind of crazy adventure with a kangaroo named Jack and a Jacket I 
              got in Brooklyn. Things turned out well but I sure hope my next visit is a bit
              more tame. Maybe check out a museum or something.

              We loved the sights and sounds. We went to sydney and the city is rich with 
              culture. I feel like if someone were wto use this as an example on a site or 
              something it would be clear they've run out of movie quotes and ideas.
